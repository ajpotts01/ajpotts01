Technologist, jazz guitar student, and combat sports tragic living in Sydney, Australia.
Craft beer üç∫ nerd currently working for Endeavour Group - I'm still pinching myself in disbelief.

I was a software developer for 10+ years, but always did a bit of everything:
- Desktop, mobile and web dev in numerous frameworks and languages - but most at-home with C# and Python
- "Old-school" business intelligence with the SQL Server Stack
- Sometimes I even put my infrastructure and networking hat on

I took a hard right turn into "modern" data engineering a little while ago, and that is my "focus". In reality, I'm up for any technical challenge - especially when it's something my teams are struggling with and they need someone to figure new things out quickly.

Even in data engineering I'm a generalist - I was a Databricks and Synapse consultant, but am most at home in the BigQuery ecosystem on the Google Cloud Platform.

My repositories are usually things I'm building while I read books or do Udemy courses, but I did do a good look into streaming data pipelines (and stringing together as many SaaS trials as possible) in a group project [here](https://github.com/ajpotts01/eventsim_streaming). 

Here is what I'm currently interested in:
- Data and machine learning engineering options on Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure
- Getting back up to date with .NET and SPA frameworks
- Full-stack web development options with Python (Django/Flask)
- All the ops buzzwords - Data/ML/DevOps
- Automation with UiPath and Power Automate
- Low code app frameworks like Power Platform and Retool
- Further developing my data analyst/scientist skillset
