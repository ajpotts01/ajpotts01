Cloud technologist, jazz guitar student, and combat sports tragic living in Sydney, Australia.
I currently work in cybersecurity data for the Woolworths Group.

I was a software developer for 10+ years, but always did a bit of everything:
- Desktop, mobile and web dev in numerous frameworks and languages - but most at-home with C# and Python
- "Old-school" business intelligence with the SQL Server Stack
- Sometimes I even put my infrastructure and networking hat on

I took a hard right turn into "modern" data engineering a little while ago, and that is my "focus". In reality, I'm up for any technical challenge - especially when it's something my teams are struggling with and they need someone to figure new things out quickly.

Even in data engineering I'm a generalist - I was a Databricks and Synapse consultant, but am most at home in the BigQuery ecosystem on the Google Cloud Platform.

My repositories are usually things I'm building while I read books or do Udemy courses, but I did do a good look into streaming data pipelines (and stringing together as many SaaS trials as possible) in a group project [here](https://github.com/ajpotts01/eventsim_streaming). 

Here is what I'm currently interested in:
- Data and analytics engineering
- Machine learning engineering and MLOps
- Cloud and platform engineering
- Software engineering with Python and Go
